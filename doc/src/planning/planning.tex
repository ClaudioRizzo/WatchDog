\small{We had the idea to develop a remote control application after seeing there was not something similar not embedded in a more general application (in fact every anti-malware for mobile devices have a similar functionality, but it comes along with many others features) and because we really like the security/privacy (and cryptography) aspects of computer science. We planned the security/cryptography aspects from the beginning, such that the Confidentiality/Integrity/Availability paradigm is always respected along with the extremely important authentication and non-repudiation aspects.}
