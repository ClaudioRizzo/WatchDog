\paragraph{Error management} \hspace{0pt} \\
Every ecception raised by the system, every message not validated, the hashes mismatch and the user refuse to the association are all treated in the same way: all the preferences relative to the other user are deleted, then a message made by "CODE6FFF" is sent to the other. Such code is accepted by the system if and only if the SMP session is still pending and not finished; the code has the effect of making the system delete all the preferences relative to the other mobile. After that a new "CODE6FFF" is sent; the whole thing doesn't loop because the "CODE6FFF" is ignored if there are no saved preferences relative to the other cellphone. This ensures in case of errors both telephones delete the preferences (and the SMP log) in which is present a reference to the other one, so in an eventual next SMP between the same two mobiles there won't be errors due to already existent preferences.
