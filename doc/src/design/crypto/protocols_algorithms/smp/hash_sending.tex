\paragraph{Hash sending} \hspace{0pt} \\
After storing the secret question, the system notifies the user of the existence of a pending association request: the person at this point can decide to refuse (which is managed as an error) or to insert the answer to the secret question and confirm. Now the system computes a SHA-256 hash of the concatenation of the public key and the given answer; the next step is sending to the other such hash prepended by "CODE4FFF" and to update the SMP log. The receiver validates the message and updates his log too.
