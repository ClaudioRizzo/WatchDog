\subsubsection{Socialist Millionaire Protocol}
The Socialist Millionaire protocol purpose is to mutual authenticate public keys so that a logical binding is created between a key and a phisical device; this solves the active MITM problem. Since a java implementation of the original SMP was not available, we coded our own version of it which also embeds ECDH to spare time: the whole protocol is based on messages exchanging.
