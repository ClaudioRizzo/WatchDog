\subsection{Purpose} 
\small{The application purpose is to provide a way to remote control a mobile phone from another cellphone: this is very useful in case of theft or loss, since it's possible to localize the target phone or to trigger a full volume repeating alarm sound. The application is mainly intended to be used by the same user on two (or more) different mobiles, althought it's not mandatory.}
