\subsubsection{Mobile phone remote alarm triggering}
\small{The alarm triggering must either turn on or turn off a siren on the target cellphone, along with notifying back the result (or the error with a proper message) to the controller. It also has to check every five seconds if the siren is still running, restarting it if that's not the case; furthermore it must keep setting the volume to the max possible to ensure the siren is as much noisy as possible.}
