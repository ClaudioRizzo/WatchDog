\subsubsection{Initialization wizard}
The first time the appliction is opened the user sees a welcome message and his prompted to comlete the initialization wizard which consists in selecting and confirming a password which will be the one needed by other telephones/users to send commands to that mobile. The password scheme forces to select an alphanumeric string (some special characters are also allowed) between 8-20 characters and with at least a letter and a number. In case of error (bad password/confirmation password different from the base one) the user is notified back and asked to retry. In case of success the application redirects to the main view, which is the "sms localization" one.
