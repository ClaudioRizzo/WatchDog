\subsubsection{Password change}
\small{The user types the old password, the new password and the confirmation new password; the system checks whether the old one is correct and the new ones are coherent and rules compliant (see initialization wizard use case). If not an error message is prompted and nothing is done, otherwise the password is succesfully updated and the user notified back.}
