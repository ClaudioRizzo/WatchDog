\subsubsection{Remote control: localization}
The user (which sees a list of his contacts/associated numbers) types the target password and confirms the intention to send a localize command by clicking on the apposite button. After an handshake (done by sms exchanging) the target phone executes the command and sends back a failure message or his actual coordinates. The original sender receives a notification with a map and a marker indicating the target position.
