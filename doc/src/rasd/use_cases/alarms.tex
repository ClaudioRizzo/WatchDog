\subsubsection{Remote control: alarm triggering/untriggering}
The user selects from his contacts the target and confirms by clicking on a specific button the will to send a siren on/siren off command. The command session is similar to the localization one: the only difference is that the returned message is only an ack or a failure code. The siren off is simply ignored if the alarm in not active. There is also a feature which allows a user to turn off locally a siren by inserting the password and clicking on the button.
