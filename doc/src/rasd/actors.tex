\subsection{Actors} 
\small{As said before, the main actor is usually a single user which uses the application on two different mobile phones, one being the stolen/lost one and the other the rescue one. It's also possible a second actor to exists: a (very) trusted friend may be the one who sends remote commands to the target telephone; since a password authentication scheme is employed, it's not possible to do any abuse in this case.}
