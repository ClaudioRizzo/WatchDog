\paragraph{Sender authentication} \hspace{0pt} \\
\small{While the sender (telephone) authentication plays indeed a key role, it's even more crucial the authentication of the person behind a control message; that's the reason for employing a password based authentication scheme: in the initialization wizard the user is required to insert a password which is going to be needed to send a message to that telephone (the basic assumption is the password is known only by the mobile owner and by some people, possibly no one, he trusts). The password is stored hashed with SHA-256 in the application preferences, along with the hashing salt (a random token) to avoid both time-to-memory attacks (such as rainbow tables) and the equality of two hashes generated from two equal passwords; the salt is sent to another telephone after the process of public keys authentication (See section 4.3.6).}
