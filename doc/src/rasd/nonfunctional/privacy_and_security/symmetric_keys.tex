\paragraph{Symmetric key/initialization vector management} \hspace{0pt} \\
\small{AES-256, being a symmetric cipher, encrypts and decrypts a specific message with the same key, and, given the communication channel is not secure, the two parts must agree on the same key in some way; in particular ECDH is used to compute a common secret once and for all, then, when in need to send a message, the sender picks up a random 32 bytes salt, forwards it to the receiver, then both parts use a keyschedule algorithm (PBKDF2 with HMAC-SHA-256) to derive the same key starting from the secret and the salt. Furthermore the GCM mode of operation requires for every message the sender to generate a 12 bytes random initialization vector and to send it to the receiver.}
