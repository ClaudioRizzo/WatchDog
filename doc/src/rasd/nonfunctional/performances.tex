\subsubsection{Performances}
We chose the crypto algorithms with an eye on the performances of the whole system: the key idea is the bottleneck must be the sms and not the computation time required by the encryptions/decryptions; for this reason the command messages are encrypted with a symmetric algorithm and not with RSA or ElGamal (or another asymmetric algorithm), since symmetric cryptography is faster than asymmetric at least by two orders of magnitude (they are very likely to be 3 anyway); however to do ECDH and ECDSA the application needs also an asymmetric key pair, which is generate during the intitial wizard once an for all, so an acceptable overhead. The public keys mutual validation (SMP + ECDH in practice) takes some time, but it's done only one time per association, which means two telephones have to do it only when they associate themselves. Finally the digital signature/verification process are quite fast and so is the key-derivation from the secret and the salt.
