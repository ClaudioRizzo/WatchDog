\section{Initialization}
The first time the appliction is opened the user sees a welcome message and his
prompted to comlete the initialization wizard which consists in selecting and
confirming a password which will be the one needed by other telephones/users
to send commands to that mobile. The password scheme forces to select an
alphanumeric string (some special characters are also allowed) between 8-
20 characters and with at least a letter and a number. In case of error
(bad password/confirmation password different from the base one) the user is
notified back and asked to retry. In case of success the application redirects
to the main view, which is the "sms localization" one.

\section{Mobile Phone Association}
For enhanced security it’s required two telephones are associated before they
can send commands to the other one; the association is bidirectional and can
be removed only locally (the other telephone won’t know anything, but will
obviously fail in sending commands). This totally cuts away the possibility of
a Man In The Middle (MITM) both active and passive. A user who wants
to associate his telephone with another one first selects a secret question
and a secret answer and sends the first to the other mobile, whose user can
decide to accept or refuse the request. In the second case the first user is
notified back and the association ends with a "failure", otherwise the second
user types what he thinks is the secret answer and selects his own secret
question/answer. The first user now has to type the answer to that question
and, if all goes smooth, the association is done. Every passage is done by
sms sending.

\section{Password Change}

The user types the old password, the new password and the confirmation new
password; the system checks whether the old one is correct and the new ones
are coherent and rules compliant (see initialization wizard use case). If not
an error message is prompted and nothing is done, otherwise the password is
succesfully updated and the user notified back.
