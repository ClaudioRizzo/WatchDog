\section{Context}

Watchdog is an application for Android devices developed by Claudio Rizzo
and Emanuele Uliana for the "Design and Implementation of Mobile Appli-
cations" (DIMA in short) course at "Politecnico di Milano, Corso di studi in
Ingegneria Informatica Magistrale". The advisor is professor Luciano Baresi
from the Deepse (Dependable, Evolvable, Pervasive Software Engineering)
group of the Deib (Dipartimento di Elettronica, Informazione e Bioingegne-
ria).

\section{Purpose}

The application purpose is to provide a way to remote control a mobile phone
from another cellphone: this is very useful in case of theft or loss, since it’s
possible to localize the target phone or to trigger a full volume repeating
alarm sound. The application is mainly intended to be used by the same user
on two (or more) different mobiles, althought it’s not mandatory.
