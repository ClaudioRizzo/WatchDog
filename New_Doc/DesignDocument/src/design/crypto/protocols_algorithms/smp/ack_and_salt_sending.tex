\paragraph{Ack and password salt sending} \hspace{0pt} \\
After validating the hash message, the system fetches the key previously stored in the keysquare (removing it from there) and the secret answer saved in the preferences an the beginning of the SMP, and computes an hash in the same way the other telephone did. If the two hashes don't match, the public key is not validated and an error occurs, otherwise the key is saved in the keyring; now the system takes the password salt (saved in the preferences during the initialization wizard) and sends it to the other cellphone prepended by "CODE5FFF", which has the meaning of an ack; then of course the log is updated. In parallel a secret is computed with the received public key and the private key fetched from the preferences: in this sense ECDH is embedded into SMP. The receiver validates the message, updates the log, and stores the salt into his preferences, encoded in Base64.
