\paragraph{Hash sending} \hspace{0pt} \\
After storing the secret question, the system notifies the user of the existence of a pending association request: the person at this point can decide to refuse (which is managed as an error) or to insert the answer to the secret question and confirm. If we are in the first half of the SMP (the user who can accept/refuse to send his key has not validated the other public key), also the secret question/answer to be used in the second half must be provided (basically they are stored in the preferences). Now the system computes a SHA-256 hash of the concatenation of the public key and the given answer; the next step is sending to the other such hash prepended by "CODE4FFF" and to update the SMP log. The receiver validates the message and updates his log too.
