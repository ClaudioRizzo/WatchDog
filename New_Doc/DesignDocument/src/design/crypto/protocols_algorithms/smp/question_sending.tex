\paragraph{Question sending} \hspace{0pt} \\
After receiving the public key, the system saves the event in the preferences, then fetches from there the previously stored secret question, sends it to the other appended to the header "CODE3FFF" and saves into the preferences this sending event. The receiver validates the message, updates the SMP log file in his preferences and stores the received question.
