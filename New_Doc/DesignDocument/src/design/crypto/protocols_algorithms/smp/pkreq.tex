\paragraph{Public key request} \hspace{0pt} \\
When someone wants to associate his telephone with another one (and vice versa, which is automatic), and confirms his will by clicking on the apposite button, the system stores the inserted secret question and its answer, then generates a message made by the header "CODE1FFF" (intended hexadecimal as all the similar codes later descripted) and a null body, and sends it to the other mobile, writing into the preferences that the message has been sent. The meaning of the code is a request for the other public key. The receiver, after verifying (in the so called from now on "message validation") the message arrived in a right moment (i.e.: not during another SMP session with the same user), writes into the preferences the occurred event.
