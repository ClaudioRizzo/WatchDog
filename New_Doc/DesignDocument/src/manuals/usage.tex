\section{Usage}
\small{The user, after doing the initialization wizard can access the functionalities by clicking on two buttons: the one on the left upper part of the screen opens the drawer which provides access to the remote sms control (siren/localization) and to the perimeter and local siren stop features. The one on the right upper part opens the action bar (actually different telephones may have different way to open the action bar, but that's independent from our application) which provides access to the association, password change, deassociation and pending requests features.}
